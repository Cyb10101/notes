# Notes

These are my public notes.

It is a small collection of useful things. Mainly for the PC.

Usually everything is written in english. If not, it's german. Sometimes you have to be a little lazy.

Much of it is for advanced users, but some is also for beginners. You should know how a terminal works! Or in other words:

> Why do programmers have no problems at the airport?
> Because they know that terminals are not just for airplanes.

**I don't really have to mention:**

* Always think what you are doing!
* If you don't understand it, don't do it!
* Think always about safety!
* If you build shit, you have to face the consequences.
* Don't burn others down, just because you're bored and you don't have a reasonable hobby!

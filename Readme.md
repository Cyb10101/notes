# Notes

These are my public notes.

It is a small collection of useful things. Mainly for the PC.

**I don't really have to mention:**

* Always think what you are doing!
* If you don't understand it, don't do it!
* Think always about safety!
* If you build shit, you have to face the consequences.
* Don't burn others down, just because you're bored and you don't have a reasonable hobby!

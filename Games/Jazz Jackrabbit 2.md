## Own levels (Jazz Creation Station)

Click on "[No TileSet]" in the LEFT UPPER WINDOW, whereupon a list of all tile sets appears.
Choose one of them, for example "Carrottus 1".

You will then see the building blocks for your level.
Click on such a building block and insert it in the RIGHT UPPER window.

Click once on the number 8 in the RIGHT UPPER window and fill the whole area with any stones.
Otherwise you would have no background for your level and in the game everything would "blur".

If you want a line break for the text events want to use, insert an AT character (@).

The texts can also be colored.
To do this, use the pipe symbol (|) again.
To the colors automatically to change through, you just put a WHITE (#) BEFORE the text.

# Linux: Secure Boot

## Module signing for drivers

*Note: Must be run after new kernel update!*

@todo [Linux Secure Boot: Module signing should go automatically](https://github.com/Cyb10101/notes/issues/1)

When the secure boot has been activated, some drivers have to be signed.

See file: [module-signing.sh](module-signing.sh)

Modules:

* evdi: DisplayLink
* vboxdrv: VirtualBox
